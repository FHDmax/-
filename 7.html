<div class="main3"><h1 id="mov">Moving The ball</h1>
<p>Basketball is a game filled with movement. Players are always moving on the court. It’s important to understand how you can move with the ball in the game.
    There are four ways that players can move with.
    </p>
    <h2>Passing</h2>
    <p>Passing is the fastest way to move the ball on the court. Players can pass the ball with one or two hands and can use an overhand or underhand motion. The fastest way to pass the ball is to use two hands and push it in the air directly towards a teammate to catch. This is referred as an air pass. Bouncing the ball off the floor is also allowed but is slower. This called a bounce pass.</p>
    <h2>Shooting</h2>
    <p>Shooting is another way to move the ball on the court. Shooting the ball in the basket is the only way to earn points for your team. Players may shoot from anywhere on the court, but usually will elect to shoot from within or around the three point line.</p>
    <h2>Dribbling</h2>
    <p>Dribbling is an action where the ball-handler repeatedly bounces the ball off the floor. Dribbling is the only way you can move the ball on the court while having the same player keep the ball.</p>
    <h2>Pivoting</h2>
    <p>Pivoting is when a player has the ball and rotates around their foot. When a player starts to pivot, they can’t dribble again, but they can pass or shoot. Pivoting involves skillful footwork, and can be gained to step into a better passing or shooting position.</p>

<div class="main4"><h1 id="fou">Fouls</h1>
<p>A foul in basketball is a rule-breaking action that results in a loss of possession and possible free throws. There are multiple categories of fouls: <br>
    Personal Fouls: A foul that is physical in nature, like grabbing and pushing. <br>
    Flagrant Fouls: A foul that involves extraordinary violent contact with an opposing player or a dangerous, non-basketball play. <br>
    Technical Fouls: A foul that is unsportsmanlike, including screaming at the referee or an opponent. <br>
    In the NBA, if a player commits six fouls in a game, they are disqualified from playing in the rest of the game. Players can also foul out FIBA and college basketball, but the foul limit is five fouls. <br>
    The referees in basketball are responsible for calling fouls and violations throughout the game. The crew chief is the head official and makes the final decision on the court. <br>
    Fouls are different from rule violations. A foul counts towards a player or team's overall foul count, while a rule violation will typically only result in a turnover. Violations such as shot clock violations, three-second violations, and traveling do not count as fouls. <br>
